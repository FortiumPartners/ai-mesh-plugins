Refine and enhance an existing Product Requirements Document based on stakeholder
feedback, additional research, or identified gaps. Updates PRD while maintaining
version history and traceability.

## Workflow

### Phase 1: PRD Review

**1. Current PRD Analysis**
   Review existing PRD content

**2. Interview users**
   REQUIRED: Conduct user interview BEFORE making any changes.
Present identified gaps and ask clarifying questions:
- Are there any requirements that are unclear or need more detail?
- Are there missing user scenarios we should address?
- Are the acceptance criteria complete and testable?
- Is the scope correctly defined (in-scope vs out-of-scope)?
- Are there any technical constraints or dependencies not captured?
- What is the priority order of the features/requirements?
- Are there any open questions or decisions that need resolution?


**3. Feedback Integration**
   Incorporate stakeholder feedback

### Phase 2: Enhancement

**1. Content Refinement**
   Enhance clarity, detail, and completeness

**2. Validation**
   Ensure all sections meet quality standards

### Phase 3: Output Management

**1. PRD Update**
   Update PRD with version history

## Expected Output

**Format:** Refined Product Requirements Document (PRD)

**Structure:**
- **Updated PRD**: Enhanced PRD with feedback incorporated
- **Version History**: Changelog of updates and refinements
